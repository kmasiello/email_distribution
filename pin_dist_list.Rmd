```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

* Create an email distribution list of recipients
* pin the distribution list to Connect
* use a scheduled ETL process and blastula to email the distribution list

# Create the email distribution list
This can be from any source.  For now, I'll manually put this in. 
```{r}
distribution <- data.frame(Name = c("Katie", "Elena", "Josiah", "Colin", "Brian", "Nichole", "Ryan", "Shannon", "Cole", "Tonya"), Email = c("katie.masiello@rstudio.com", "elena@rstudio.com", "josiah@rstudio.com", "colin@rstudio.com", "brian.law@rstudio.com", "nichole@rstudio.com", "ryan@rstudio.com", "shannon@rstudio.com", "cole@rstudio.com", "tonya@rstudio.com"))

distribution
```
# Pin it

```{r}
library(pins)
board_register(
    "rsconnect", 
    server = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"), 
    key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY"))

pin(distribution, board = "rsconnect")
```
